# ICON Science to advance Geosciences: Introduction to special collection
By [@Goldman2022IntegratedCoordinatedOpen]

## Problem
The relevance of ICON principles and how to best use them across the spectrum of geosciences is unknown

[2020_Jan_22](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A7ZMnZ9DtjMu8n26NdwW3rDPKcBsa50_IW9rpXGhLvo/edit#slide=id.g7c97ae0544_0_150) fragmented scientific advances that make inefficient use of available resources and that fail to discover key principles that can enable humans to predict, control, and mitigate towards beneficial outcomes. In addition, missed opportunities to integrate science across sectors to enable otherwise impossible discovery.

* The complexity of integration across disciplines can make it challenging to achieve
* Data and findings are often collected in a way that makes difficult to compare them across space and time
* Open access in data repositories and research publications is one component...also, "dark data": data collected before online and digitized data collecton tools, and lack of centralized and organized catalogs ([@Belem2022]). "Opennes measured in publications does not translate to opennes for the average citizen in the world"
* Current and historical disenfranchisement that restrics certain groups from participating in the economic marketplace, scientific forums, governance, and other spaces that ultimately affect decision making. International cultural differences and resource variances that can cause the contributions of researchers in low-income and under-resourced countriesto be undervalued or diminished. Lack of understanding of historical scientific content, and subsequently misinterpretation of results and improper conclusions. This can lead to unintentional harm from research efforts. 
## So What
The way that scientific research is designed and carried out influences who and what benefits from the research outcomes, and how transferable those outcomes are.

## Solution
A collection of commentary articles was crowdsourced across the geosciences  to fill this gap. 

* The Integration principle...
* The Coordination principle addresses the need to share protocols and methods that allow for improved quality and utility of the data generated resulting from consistency in their collection
* The Openness principle encompasses the whole lifecycle of research: provocation, ideation, knowledge generation, evaluation, dissemination, and preservation. It is also intentionally defined to include the FAIR data principles ([@Wilkinson2016]). 
* The Networked principle aims to designing research to be mutually beneficial for people involved/impacted. It is inherently linked to diversity, equity, inclusion, and environmental justice. The “Networked” principle is intended to elevate equity by identifying where sciences can be built on the foundation of mutual benefit through strategic scientific resourcing. An important component of this is considering not just the benefit but also intentional reduction of harm.
## Benefits
ICON principles represent a unified approach that can be used across the geosciences to improve how research is designed and implemented with the aim of maximizing the benefits and trasnferability of research efforts within and beyond the research team.

In addition, more efficient use of resources, translating research dollars into scientific advancement/discovery. And an enhanced capacity to do big science that is globally applicable

* Integration across disciplines is key to scientific impact and advancement
* Discover explanations and causality to phenomena regardless of location and time. The importance of the "Coordination" principle extends beyond physical sample collection, it can also encompass data and code production, and processing methods across interdisciplinary teams
* Openness..
* Work being done to strengthen the access and role of indigenous peoples in geoscience research. Valuing the expertise of local leadership and communities to strengthen sciencitific arguments
