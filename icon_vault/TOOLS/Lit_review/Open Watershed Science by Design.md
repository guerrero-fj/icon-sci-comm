### Problem
"the need for integrative research to connect environmental microbes, multiomics, plant system dynamics, biogeochemical interactions, and hydrological processes to understand ecosystem function."

"need for greater openness and coordination of multiwatershed distributed research efforts that integrate across capabilities within the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) and link to those of other agencies"
### So What
Predictions about earth system responses to disturbance, including extreme events 
### Solution
Designing science for mutual benefits and transferable knowledge. We offer 4 overarching principles: Integration, Coordination, Openness, and Networked. 

### Benefits
"Improving predictions of the Earth system in response to disturbance, including extreme events based on connections across scales of space, time, and biological complexity ."

"Collectively, SBR research activities directly address the Microbial to Earth System Pathways grand challenges identified by the Biological and Environmental Research Advisory Committee (BERAC) in its 2017 grand challenges report (BERAC 2017), as well as some aspects of the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences grand challenges.""
