Each commentary focuses on a different topic: (a) Global collaboration, technology transfer, and application (Section 2), (b) Community engagement, community science, education, and stakeholder involvement (Section 3), and (c) Field, experimental, remote sensing, and real-time data research and application (Section 4). We discuss needs and strategies for implementing ICON and outline short- and long-term goals. The inclusion of global data and international community engagement are key to tackling grand challenges in biogeosciences. Although recent technological advances and growing open-access information across the world have enabled global collaborations to some extent, several barriers, ranging from technical to organizational to cultural, have remained in advancing interoperability and tangible scientific progress in biogeosciences. Overcoming these hurdles is necessary to address pressing large-scale research questions and applications in the biogeosciences, where ICON principles are essential. Here, we list several opportunities for ICON, including coordinated experimentation and field observations across global sites, that are ripe for implementation in biogeosciences as a means to scientific advancements and social progress.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Dwivedi","given":"D."},{"family":"Santos","given":"A.

  {"id":"Goldman2022IntegratedCoordinatedOpen","abstract":"The sciences struggle to integrate across disciplines, coordinate across data generation and modeling activities, produce connected open data, and build strong networks to engage stakeholders within and beyond the scientific community. The American Geophysical Union (AGU) is divided into 25 sections intended to encompass the breadth of the geosciences. Here, we introduce a special collection of commentary articles spanning 19 AGU sections on challenges and opportunities associated with the use of ICON science principles. These principles focus on research intentionally designed to be Integrated, Coordinated, Open, and Networked (ICON) with the goal of maximizing mutual benefit (among stakeholders) and cross-system transferability of science outcomes. This article (a) summarizes the ICON principles; (b) discusses the crowdsourced approach to creating the collection; (c) explores insights from across the articles; and (d) proposes steps forward. There were common themes among the commentary articles, including broad agreement that the benefits of using ICON principles outweigh the costs, but that using ICON principles has important risks that need to be understood and mitigated. It was also clear that the ICON principles are not monolithic or static, but should instead be considered a heuristic tool that can and should be modified to meet changing needs. As a whole, the collection is intended as a resource for scientists pursuing ICON science and represents an important inflection point in which the geosciences community has come together to offer insights into ICON principles as a unified approach for improving how science is done across the geosciences and beyond.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldman","given":"A.

  {"id":"Wilkinson2016","abstract":"There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Dumontier","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Aalbersberg","given":"IJsbrand Jan"},{"family":"Appleton","given":"Gabrielle"},{"family":"Axton","given":"Myles"},{"family":"Baak","given":"Arie"},{"family":"Blomberg","given":"Niklas"},{"family":"Boiten","given":"Jan-Willem"},{"family":"Silva Santos","given":"Luiz Bonino","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Bourne","given":"Philip E."},{"family":"Bouwman","given":"Jildau"},{"family":"Brookes","given":"Anthony J."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Crosas","given":"Mercè"},{"family":"Dillo","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Dumon","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Edmunds","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Evelo","given":"Chris T."},{"family":"Finkers","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Gonzalez-Beltran","given":"Alejandra"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Alasdair J.
