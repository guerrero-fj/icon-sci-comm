# Designing Collaborative Science for Mutual Benefits and Transferable Knowledge

## Slide 1
Hi there!

Welcome to ICON.

An ongoing effort to enable researchers from all domains to implement ICON science for mutually beneficial outcomes, transferable results, and enhancing scientific equity.

There are different ways to engage with ICON,

## Slide 2
One of them is our worksheet. A set of thought-provoking questions aimed to elicit discussion about how ICON Science looks for different teams.

The current demands and styles of teamwork, including remote teams, and asynchronous collaboration, require higher levels of interactivity and engagement. 

So, we wanted to increase the worksheet’s broad usability and give teams the freedom to work at any time, day or night, with a virtual guide.
## Slide 3
Because of that we are now launching ICON Studio! 

A space to design collaborative science following ICON principles.

Now, if all these sound new to you, let me start by briefly describing what ICON principles are, where they come from, and why we need them so urgently in science.

## Slide 4
The scientific challenges we face are complex.

These challenges encompass multiple scales in space and time and levels of human organization. 

Yet, our advances are still fragmented.

Our use of available resources is often inefficient.

We still struggle to discover critical principles that enable us to predict, manage, and achieve beneficial outcomes for all of us.

## Slide 5
We need a unified approach to improving how research is designed and implemented.

And this is precisely what ICON means: a set of principles to help you maximize the benefits and transferability of your science within and beyond the research team.

ICON principles form a framework to guide the intentional design of any scientific endeavor.

## Slide 6
ICON is intended as a tool or heuristic to help researchers intentionally bring these principles into their projects by design.

As such, ICON Science Integrates physical, chemical, biological, and social attributes and scales (spatial/temporal);

Coordinates the use of consistent protocols and methods across systems and researchers to enable transferability;

Openly exchanges ideas, data, software, and models throughout the research lifecycle.

It also aims for all those research objects to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).

Open and FAIR science enable all researchers to contribute and leverage resources; and

ICON Science Networks efforts. Research is designed and implemented with many stakeholders to achieve mutual benefit.

Now, you may still wonder why ICON your science. Here are some ideas:

## Slide 7
Integration across disciplines is key to scientific impact and advancement.

Coordination allows for discovering explanations and causality to phenomena, regardless of location and time.

Openness across the research lifecycle dramatically increases opportunities for community engagement.

Networks strengthen the access of multiple stakeholders to research. Also, networked science makes scientific arguments stronger by valuing the expertise of local leaders and communities.

Now the question is HOW to ICON your science?

## Slide 8
Which takes us back to ICON studio. 

We have created an additional resource to help you design collaborative science for mutual benefits and transferable knowledge. 

We reorganized the questions in the original worksheet into steps that should make it easy for you to navigate the process.

We have divided this entry journey into the ICONverse into two parts: Understanding and Designing with ICON principles.

These two parts correspond to two different sessions with slightly different approaches.

In Part I,  you will share, explore, prioritize, and operationalize ICON principles with your team.

## Slide 9
In Part II you will work on the interactions among principles.

Building from your answers in Part I, you will explore such interactions through a "Design matrix". 

We will address Part II in a separate video.
## Slide 10
The rest of this video focuses on Part I.

Let's talk about the activities and goals you would accomplish during your first session.
## Slide 11
First, share your values…

What do you value the most about teamwork in science?

The goal of this activity is to Acknowledge and understand how each team member’s background manifests as values, affecting decisions.

## Slide 12
Second, explore  ICON principles…

How can we make ICON principles more relatable to our teams?

This activity aims to Identify examples from previous research that have applied at least one of the ICON principles.

## Slide 13
Third, prioritize ICON Principles

How can we plan our ICON efforts according to our capacity and resources?

Through this activity, you will assess (broadly) how much time, energy, or money will be put into implementing each principle. Then, prioritize the implementation of each principle accordingly.

## Slide 14
And fourth, Operationalize ICON principles

How do ICON principles apply in multiple dimensions of your team effort?

The goal here is to Answer a series of prompts to initiate a write storming on what ICON looks like in your work.
## Slide 15
Now, we have been talking about ICON studio as a space and a resource.

What we mean by that is a fully Interactive Worksheet or I-Worksheet, build in MURAL. 

For those who are new to the concept, MURAL is a shared digital canvas that allows visual collaboration for teamwork.

We aim for both this short video and the I-Worksheet to be self-contained and self-explanatory.

## Slide 16
Each section in the I-Worksheet is articulated through instructions, guiding questions, or both.

Responses to the questions are provided individually by each team member through sticky notes in a designated space.

We have added some literature to help you clarify some concepts and dig deeper into some of the ideas used for the design of this I-worksheet.

Although this MURAL can be used asynchronously, we strongly encourage its use as part of a team discussion.

We have identified the sections that benefit the most from synchronous team activities and which are more flexible  for asynchronous work.

A suggested time allocation (as a fraction of a total) is indicated at the beginning of each section.

## Slide 17
So, are [YOU] ready?

Feel free to explore this tool, the link is also in the description of this video.

If you want to use it with your team, let us know and will get you access to a working copy of the MURAL.
## Slide 18
We’d love to hear from you!

We are here to help!

Let’s connect!
## Slide 19
Let’s ICON your science!
