#### Note
Meeting on Aug 2, 2022 to discuss EXCHANGE's beta test of 'How to ICON' worksheet [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MlpLYfwf46ca_s8A0SCBRf7myRLowmjcghIXIqAyiAM/edit)
Emerging question: How to take the steps from the worksheet to generate an ICONization plan? Something like a [Theory of Change](https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-020-0202-3)?
[[Vanessa Bailey]] would like elevator pitch for ambassadors to use when they present to people and listing of ICONic projects.
[[Nick Ward]]: Might be most impactful in proposal or early project stages, and then integrate as part of annual review processes. The document was long and intimidating because of the length. Felt like quite the homework assignment.
